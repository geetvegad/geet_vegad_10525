# 🍔 Online Food Order Simulation System (C)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is an **Online Food Order Simulation System** developed using **C language**.  
It calculates the **total bill** based on the food items selected by the user and their quantities.  
The project uses **arrays, loops, and functions** to implement the ordering and billing logic.
